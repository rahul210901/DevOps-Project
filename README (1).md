Deploying todo-web-app using DevOps & AWS


In this major project I have used DevOps and AWS to deploy any webapp.

What is DevOps?
DevOps is a software development and delivery approach that aims to bridge the gap between development (Dev) and operations (Ops) teams. It fosters a culture of collaboration and communication, enabling faster delivery of high-quality software while maintaining operational stability and efficiency.
In traditional software development models, the development and operations teams often worked in silos, resulting in delays and miscommunications. DevOps seeks to break down these barriers, allowing for a more streamlined process from ideation to production.

What is AWS?
Amazon Web Services is one of the most important cloud service providers these days. AWS cloud has many management tools, that make it even more robust. Now they are providing us with the best quality cloud solutions with more than 200 cloud services.

How my project works?

Basically I have taken the code from the github and as I was making project on DevOps it is compulsory that I should have knowledge about CLI and linux because As, a DevOps engineer we have to work on that product should be delivered to the customer smoothly and webapp should remain updated everytime whenever the developer makes the changes to the app it should be reflected on the APP as well.

Devops -- Devops also works on the continuous testing, intergration as well.

So, I have created a pipeline to automate the changes and app properly and I have attached load balancer as well so that app does not get crashed when the traffic increases on the webapp.

And as I have done my whole project on AWS it is always accessible from anywhere
